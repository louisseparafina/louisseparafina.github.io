				<p>Skills</p>
				<p>Digital & Traditional Painting</p>
				<p>Painting is the only skill that I could proudly say to a lot of people because, that's really my passion. If only I could risk everything and money isn't a problem, I'd really pick computer animation & illustration related courses but I still truly enjoy the course I have today. </p>

				<p>Strength & </p>
				<p>Weaknesses</p>
				<p>as an aspiring IT Professional</p>
				<p><b>STRENGTH:</b> When I was in senior high school, I was always tasked with doing the design of our applications and/or websites. I could say you could rely on me with any designing part of the application, I enjoy doing it and probably won't let you down as a team member. </p>
				<p><b>WEAKNESS:</b> I'm not that good at logic that's why I'm not really that capable of doing back-end jobs alone, I could be a help at some parts of the back-end but to entirely do it alone especially when the problem or logic is quite difficult.</p>

				<p>Career</p>
				<p>Web Developer</p>
				<p>I want a job that is related to what I am passionate about and that is illustrating or designing but also maintain myself as an IT professional, which is why even though I did not pursue Arts & Design courses as a student, I am still greatful that IT course is a very vast field and I could discover more not only with programs but user-interfaces too.  </p>
